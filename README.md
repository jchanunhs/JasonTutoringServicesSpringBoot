# JasonTutoringServicesSpringBoot
Spring Boot verison of Jason Tutoring Services

Notes
- We're using an old version of H2 due to breaking changes. Since the H2 Database is purely used for testing purposes we can keep the version at 1.4.199.
- I plan to implement light box in the netbeans picture.  
- Loading jquery UI from local machine instead of http because when loading from http it takes more time to load the page.
